"""
Comprehensive tests for Terminal Executor.

This test suite ensures 100% coverage of security-critical paths in the
Terminal Executor, including:
    - Command allowlist validation
    - Path allowlist validation
    - Timeout handling with process cleanup
    - Output truncation
    - Error handling

Security tests are marked with SECURITY comment for easy identification.

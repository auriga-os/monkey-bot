"""Shared interfaces for monkey-bot agent components.

This file defines interfaces and data structures used across the project.
With LangChain v1, many interfaces are replaced by LangChain/LangGraph primitives:
- MemoryManagerInterface → LangGraph Store + Checkpointer
- LLMClient → BaseChatModel from LangChain

Remaining interfaces for backward compatibility and skills system.

"""
Secure terminal command execution with allowlist-based security.

This module provides the TerminalExecutor class, which is the security boundary
for all shell command execution in Emonk. It implements strict allowlist validation
for both commands and file paths to prevent unauthorized operations.

Security Model:
    - Deny by default: Only pre-approved commands and paths are allowed
    - Command allowlist: ALLOWED_COMMANDS defines executable binaries
    - Path allowlist: ALLOWED_PATHS defines accessible directories
    - Timeout enforcement: All commands have maximum execution time
    - Output limits: Large outputs are truncated to prevent memory exhaustion

Example:
    >>> executor = TerminalExecutor()
    >>> result = await executor.execute("ls", ["./data/memory/"])
    >>> print(result.stdout)

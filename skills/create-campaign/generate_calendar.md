# Step 3: Generate Content Calendar

Create a posting schedule balancing:
- Consistent frequency (2-3 posts per platform per week)
- Optimal posting times for each platform
- Variety across platforms
- Content pillar rotation

For each post entry, include:
- Week number
- Platform
- Scheduled date/time
- Suggested content pillar

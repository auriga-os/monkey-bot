# Step 2: Define Campaign Strategy

Based on research, create a campaign strategy.

Required elements:
1. **Campaign Goal**: What are we trying to achieve?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are we speaking to?
3. **Key Messages**: 3-5 core messages to communicate
4. **Content Pillars**: 3-4 themes to rotate through
5. **Success Metrics**: How will we measure effectiveness?

Output as JSON:
{
  "goal": "...",
  "target_audience": "...",
  "key_messages": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "content_pillars": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "success_metrics": ["...", "..."]
}

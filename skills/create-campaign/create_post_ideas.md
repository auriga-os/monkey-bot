# Step 4: Create Post Ideas

For each calendar entry, generate a specific post idea.

Each idea should include:
1. **Angle/Hook**: What makes this post interesting?
2. **Key Message**: Core takeaway for audience
3. **Format**: Text-only, image, video, carousel, etc.
4. **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant hashtags
5. **Call-to-Action**: What should audience do?

Ensure variety:
- Mix educational, entertaining, and promotional content
- Rotate through content pillars
- Adapt tone for each platform
- Build on previous posts (storyline)

Output as JSON array matching calendar length.
